## Plugin `osticket-ai-assistant`

- **Purpose**: The AI assistant helps agents analyze ticket content and draft responses using an external AI API (OpenAI or compatible).
- **Where to apply these rules**: any changes under `include/plugins/osticket-ai-assistant/*`, including PHP classes, JS/CSS, and configuration.
- **What must be preserved**:
  - Do not break osTicket extension points (hooks, plugin interfaces, method signatures called by the core).
  - Be careful when changing integration with the AI provider: do not hardcode API keys, do not log secrets, respect timeouts and rate/usage limits.
  - Avoid heavy synchronous calls that can block the UI response; prefer deferred/asynchronous processing where possible.
- **Integrations and dependencies**: when changing interaction with the core (`include/`, `scp/`),
  ensure other plugins are not broken and follow the global rules from the root `.cursor/rules.md`.
- **Stack**:
    - PHP 8.2
    - osTicket: 1.18
